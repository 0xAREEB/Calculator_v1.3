# How it Works:

* I have created my own function in there like:

```c++

// To check if operator is accepted
getIsLegitInput(variable) 

// To perform calculation eg. plus minus etc.
calculate(var1, var2, operator)

// To check if user entered true(1) false(0) ore something else
getFilteredBoolean()

```

* Thats it  :)
